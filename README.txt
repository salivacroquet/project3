How to compile and run your program:


Any assumptions:


Additional features that you implemented (if applicable):

We implemented two helper functions. One helper function found in both Classes
checks if the list is sorted. The other helper function resizes the array if it
becomes full.

Any known bugs or defects in the program:


Any outside sources (aside from course resources) consulted for ideas used in the project, in
the format:
– idea1: source
– idea2: source
– idea3: source
