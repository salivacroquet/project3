How to compile and run your program:
The program can compile and run in the terminal or through inteliJ. 

Any assumptions:


Additional features that you implemented (if applicable):

We implemented three helper functions. One helper function found in both Classes
checks if the list is sorted (checkSort). The other helper function resizes the array if it
becomes full (resize). The last adds an other list to this list (add).

Any known bugs or defects in the program:
INCOMPLETE
- ArrayList ExclusiveOr
